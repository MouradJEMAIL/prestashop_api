# PrestaShop API Dart package

## Motivation

The story of this package began with a simple need: to seamlessly bridge a Flutter app with a PrestaShop website. I found that existing packages were insufficient because, even after integrating any of them, I still needed to:

- Create model classes to mirror API entities.
- Deal with data de/serialization.
- Manually construct API requests.
- Address the pagination feature limitation in the API.
- Figure out API errors and create tailored exceptions.
- ...

Implementing all of these tasks can result in hundreds of lines of code, increasing the likelihood of errors. These main factors drove me to create the prestashop_api package from scratch.

prestashop_api package alleviates most of those burdens by implementing much of this for you, allowing you to focus more on your app's functionalities.

Let's explore the package's capabilities together!

## Quickstart

An example speaks volumes compared to a lengthy abstract explanation, so here's a typical request to fetch products:

### 1. Add to pubspec.yaml

```yaml
dependencies:
  prestashop_api: ^0.0.1
```

### 2. Import the package

```dart
  import 'package:prestashop_api/prestashop_api.dart';
```

### 3. Set the base configuration

```dart
  final baseConfig = BaseConfig(
    baseUrl: 'www.your-website.com',
    apiKey: 'YOUR-API-KEY-XXXXXXXXX',
    protocol: Protocol.https,
  );
```

### 4. Initialize PrestashopApi

```dart
  final prestashop = PrestashopApi(baseConfig);
```

Optionally, you can configure the Dio property of the PrestashopApi instance:

```dart
  // E.g., set a custom `connectTimeout` of Dio
  final customDio = Dio();
  prestashop.dio = customDio..options.connectTimeout = const Duration(seconds: 5);
```

### 5. Call a PrestaShop API

```dart
  try {
    // E.g., GET all products in the primary language
    final receivedProducts = await prestashop.getProducts(languageId: 1);

    // Print the products payload in a pretty structured JSON
    prettyPrint<Product>(
      tagText: 'Print all products',
      data: receivedProducts.entity,
      toJsonMap: productToJsonMap,
    );
  } catch (e) {
    print('Exception caught: $e');
  }
```

## Options

When calling the PrestaShop API, you can pass various options:

### 1. Display Fields

You have the option to "display" either specific fields or all fields. If no fields are specified, the API will return the default fields it defines.

```dart
  // Display `id` and `name` fields for products display
  const display = Display(
    displayFieldList: [
      ProductDisplayField.id,
      ProductDisplayField.name,
    ],
  );

  //
  // Alternatively
  //
  
  // Display all available fields of products
  const display = Display(
    displayFieldList: [
      ProductDisplayField.all,
    ],
  );
```

### 2. Filtering Data

Refine the expected result using the "filter" parameter. Below are exhaustive examples for each filter method:

```dart
  // Filter products by matching any of the specified values
  final filter = Filter.anyOf(
    ProductFilterField.id,
    values: ['1', '5'],
  );

  // Filter products by specifying an interval between two values
  final filter = Filter.between(
    ProductFilterField.id,
    begin: '1',
    end: '10',
  );

  // Filter products by exact value (case insensitive)
  final filter = Filter.equals(
    ProductFilterField.name,
    value: 'Wheels',
  );

  // Filter products by value prefix (case insensitive)
  final filter = Filter.beginsWith(
    ProductFilterField.name,
    value: 'Whe',
  );

  // Filter products by value suffix (case insensitive)
  final filter = Filter.endsWith(
    ProductFilterField.name,
    value: 'els',
  );

  // Filter products by value contained within (case insensitive)
  final filter = Filter.contains(
    ProductFilterField.name,
    value: 'eel',
  );
```

### 3. Sorting Data

Utilize the "sort" parameter to organize the expected result according to your preferences.

```dart
  // Sort products based on `id` in descending order
  final sort = Sort(
    sortFieldOrderList: [
      SortField.descending(ProductSortField.id),
    ],
  );

  //
  // Alternatively
  //

  // Sort products based on `id` in ascending order
  final sort = Sort([
    SortField.ascending(ProductSortField.id),
  ]);
```

## More Features

But wait, there's more! prestashop_api still has a host of additional features up its sleeve.

### 1. Predefined Models

prestashop_api offers prebuilt model classes that mirror PrestaShop API entities. You can use these models instantly, eliminating the need to create them manually.

### 2. Implicit Serialization / Deserialization

Effortlessly retrieve and manage data from the PrestaShop API. prestashop_api handles serialization and deserialization for you, enabling seamless conversion of data between Dart objects and JSON representations.

### 3. Enhanced Query Precision

#### Challenges

Writing queries the traditional way, poses two main challenges:

1. **Limited Field Support**
   Not all fields in the PrestaShop API support display, filtering, and sorting functionalities. This increases the risk of selecting the wrong fields and causes API error responses.

2. **Complex Syntax**
   Implementing display, filtering, and sorting functionalities in URL queries requires adherence to specific structuring rules. Failure to follow these conventions can lead to API error responses.

#### Solutions

To address these challenges, prestashop_api provides:

1. **Built-in Functionality Fields**
   Predefined fields for display, filtering, and sorting for every supported resource ensure precise query construction without the risk of selecting unsupported fields.

2. **Standardized Syntax**
   Predefined syntax for implementing functionalities simplifies query construction, reduces syntax errors, and enhances overall query precision and reliability.

### 4. Addressing Pagination Limitations

The pagination feature in the PrestaShop v1.7 API lacks information about the maximum page number in the response headers, making it difficult to determine the availability of a next page in paginated data requests. To address this limitation, prestashop_api provides a straightforward solution.
In the response of the fetch method, you can simply check the boolean 'isNextPageAvailable' to determine if a next page is available. To see the simplicity of integrating this feature in your code, please consult the following example.

### 5. Predefined tailored exceptions

prestashop_api offers a wide range of predefined exceptions, tailored for the PrestaShop API. Save time with ready-to-use exceptions for common errors and unique scenarios, allowing you to focus on building robust applications confidently.

## Example using PrestashopApi

```dart
// This file is "main.dart"
import 'package:prestashop_api/prestashop_api.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  // Configure your `BaseConfig`
  final baseConfig = BaseConfig(
    baseUrl: 'www.your-website.com',
    apiKey: 'YOUR-API-KEY-XXXXXXXXX',
    protocol: Protocol.https,
  );

  // Initialize `PrestashopApi` with base configuration
  final prestashop = PrestashopApi(baseConfig);

  // Specify the product fields to display, such as 'id' and 'name'. If left empty, only IDs will 
  // be displayed by default
  const display = Display(
    displayFieldList: [
      ProductDisplayField.id,
      ProductDisplayField.name,
    ],
  );

  // Set filter to fetch products with IDs from 1 to 20
  final filter = Filter.between(
    ProductFilterField.id,
    begin: '1',
    end: '20',
  );

  // Sort products by name in descending order
  final sort = Sort(
    sortFieldOrderList: [
      SortFieldOrder.descending(ProductSortField.name),
    ],
  );

  try {
    // Fetch products with specified parameters using pagination
    final receivedProducts = await prestashop.getProductsPage(
      // Required property: Set the language ID for product data retrieval
      languageId: 1,
      // Required property: page number
      page: 2,
      // Required property: products count per page
      perPage: 10,
      // Optional properties: filter, display, and sort functionalities
      filter: filter,
      display: display,
      sort: sort,
    );
    
    print('A next page is available: ${receivedProducts.isNextPageAvailable}');

    // Print retrieved product data in a well formatted way
    prettyPrint<Product>(
      tagText: 'Products with IDs ranging from 11 to 20',
      data: receivedProducts.entity,
      toJsonMap: productToJsonMap,
    );
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle errors
    print('Error caught: $e');
  }
}
```
